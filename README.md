# The user command `Markdown2HTML`


## Overview 

The `Markdown2HTML` user command allows you to convert one or more Markdown text files to HTML files with ease.

The user command also allows you to convert any markdown file under program control using the [MarkAPL](https://github.com/aplteam/markapl) class.

`Markdown2HTML` comes with:

1. A user command script that makes the stuff in the workspace useable from the user command framework.

1. A folder `Markdown2HTML` that contains the following:

   1. A workspace with all the stuff that can actually convert a markdown text file into an HTML file.

     The reason why this is a workspace is that for the time being the user command framework makes it difficult to store scripts in the same place as the user commands, does not recommend a way to save them elsewhere and does not support sub folders.

     We can only get around this by storing the stuff in a workspace.

   1. Two CSS files ruling the layout of the HTML files to be created.


## Installing the user command


### Version 17.0

Under version 17.0 the recommended way of installing the user comnmand is to copy the script into the default folder for personal user commands which is:

`%HomeDrive%%HomePath%\Documents\MyUCMDs`.

Note that `%HomePath%` defaults to `\Users\{yourName}\`. `{yourname}` is what `âŽ•AN` returns in an APL session.

Putting the user command into this folder has an advantage and a disadvantage:

* Pro

  It works out of the box: just copy the stuff over, start an instance of Dyalog 17.0 and the user command is available.

* Cons

  You have to do the same things for every user that's supposed to have the user command at their disposal.


### Older versions than 17.0

Because of the restrictions of the user command framework you cannot install a user command like `Markdown2HTML` in the default folder `SALT\Spice`.

It is therefore necessary to save them elsewhere and add the path to the SALT path scanned for user commands. See the SALT documentation for details.

## Updates

With version 1.1 the user command checks whether there is a file `MarkAPL.script` in the folder Markdown2HTML\. After installation there is no such file. If it does exist, the file is assumed to contain a version of the MarkAPL class, presumably a "better" one then what's saved in the workspace.

Note that the name is `MarkAPL.script` rather then `MarkAPL.dyalog` because the latter would considered to be a user command script by the user command framework; therefore when you update it yourself from <https://github.com/aplteam/MarkAPL> in order to make sure that the latest version of MarkAPL is used you **must** rename it from `MarkAPL.dyalog` to `MarkAPL.script` to avoid SALT trying to treat it as a user command.
